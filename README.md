For my Project, I wanted to create a quiz that helped Movie lovers pick a movie to watch at night. Personally, after a long day, I am very stressed and want to sit down and watch a movie to calm myself. However, I always get stressed trying to find a movie I would like to watch, so, that is why I created this short “Which movie should I watch” quiz. If I had more time I would like to make it a little more advanced, change colors, add gifs, etc (But I do like the dark look of it currently). The Main challenge for me was the buttons, I had a really hard time figuring them out and had to look for help on Youtube, Chatgpt, Reddit, etc. After going to class and getting feedback, I wanted to make the whole project more custom; Buttons, animation, etc.
